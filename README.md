# Computer-Vision

Course Description
The Computer Vision course, COMP6903051, is designed to equip students with foundational and advanced knowledge in computer vision, focusing on how computers can interpret and understand information from images and videos akin to human vision. The course begins with an introduction to the principles of image formation and standard image processing algorithms, setting the stage for understanding local features through edge and corner detection techniques. Students will then explore methods for matching different images using these features, progressing towards various recognition algorithms, including both instance and category recognition. Practical applications such as object detection are also covered, providing a comprehensive overview of the field. By the end of the course, students will be able to describe computational principles, explain and employ feature detection methods, and build effective image recognition systems, preparing them for further research or careers in computer vision.
